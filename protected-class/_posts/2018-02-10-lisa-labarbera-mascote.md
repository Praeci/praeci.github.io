excerpt: "Why don't women report sexual assaults? How meaningful is womanhood to identity? Is the #MeToo movement relevant to NC State?"

Lisa LaBarbera-Mascote is a practitioner of feminist theory. She leads a community center at NC State that she says is a bit of a misnomer: the Women's Center. What does the Center actually do? And why is it necessary in the first place?

Lisa spoke with me about Roy Moore, Title IX, class privilege, and how conversations about interpersonal violence need to improve. She also told me about the jarring experience in college that opened her eyes to issues of sexism.
