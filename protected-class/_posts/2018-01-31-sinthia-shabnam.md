Sinthia Shabnam speaks in different venues around campus with messages of unity, and acts as a humanizing face of Islam. But, she wants you to know: she is not a representative for all of Islam, and she doesn't fit the stereotypes put onto her. Hear what she has to say about anti-Islam sentiments, her one-year experience living in a community where she couldn't find her place, and why her mother was scared to see her interviewed on TV.
