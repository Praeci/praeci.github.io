excerpt: "The director of the African American Cultural Center at NC State shows me that I have a lot to learn about race and identity"
---

Moses T. Alexander Greene has a proud history, background, and upbringing. He also has a lot to teach anybody who will listen—but particularly white people like me—just how directly the history of race impacts the history of all the things we hold dear, especially our university.

Learn how NC State went from being exclusively for straight, white men to what it is today, and discussion about how we should wrestle with that history.

And yes, we talked also about Dixie. For a little background, see Student Body President Jackie Gonzalez's [op-ed published in Technician][Jackie article] on the word's usage in NC State's alma mater, and [my response][my response] to her article.
