Carolina came to NC State to learn English, and stayed to study forest biomaterials. She was lucky to surround herself with people who are understanding of when she sometimes experiences syncope (i.e. fainting), but not everybody she's met in Colombia or the United States takes her condition seriously. She says it's not uncommon for her to be laughed at when she shares about her disability, and even that an NC State employee once laughed at her while she was trying to get an accommodation.
