excerpt: "It's easier being blind if you're middle class, but you'll still be treated like an infant"
---

Lauren Siegel's difficulty seeing affects her everyday life in some ways, but most jarring are the social implications. When's the last time you were at a restaurant and the waiter asked your parents, "What does she want?" That still happens to Lauren, and she's in her second year in college.

Lauren shares stories of people stopping traffic to help her cross the street (something she regularly does perfectly well on her own), lacking blind role models growing up, and the financial costs of being born legally blind.
