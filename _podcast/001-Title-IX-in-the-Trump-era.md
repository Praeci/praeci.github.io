In the first episode of The Praeci Podcast, we spoke with Robin Kelley, NC State's deputy Title IX coordinator, about what Title IX is and how it came to protect survivors of sexual assault at American colleges and universities.

Before the Obama administration, Title IX was a much different law, but Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education for President Donald Trump, has rolled back many changes made under Obama. In this episode, we explore the effects of these changes are, and what NC State is doing in response.
