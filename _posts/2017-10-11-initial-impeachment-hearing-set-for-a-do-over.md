The committee conducting the impeachment proceedings of Student Body Treasurer John Taylor Willis has decided it will redo the initial hearing that took place September 5 due to improper proceedings that were affected by concerns pertaining to Student Conduct.

This decision rolls back previous decisions to downgrade the punishment to censure as well as the decision to remove the charge of abuse of power, essentially resetting the impeachment proceedings to the state they were in before the initial hearing.

The Government Relations and Oversight (GRO) Committee Chair Ryan Dunn released a statement with Student Senate President Mitchell Moravec on the matter.

“Chairperson Dunn and President Moravec provided the Committee with clearer information regarding the handling of concerns related to matters of the Code of Conduct and the jurisdiction and duties of the Committee in matters of punitive processes of the Senate,” they said in a statement.

Dunn and Moravec decided before the initial hearing not to hear evidence at that hearing. They say they made this decision over concerns that presenting certain evidence against Willis during the hearing would implicate GRO committee members in Student Conduct proceedings.

Dunn and Moravec were also concerned the committee would be overstepping its jurisdiction to make decisions over Student Conduct matters, but after meeting with the Associate Director of Student Conduct Jess White, these concerns have been alleviated.

Dunn and Moravec say they were given these impressions over Student Conduct matters after conversations with involved parties and advisors.

Dunn and Moravec say that the decision not to hear evidence in the initial hearing violated the rights of the committee to be fully informed during the impeachment proceedings. They also say this decision violated the rights of the accused (Willis) and accusers (sponsors of the bill to impeach Willis) to have a fair trial.

After sharing this information with the committee, GRO voted in favor of resetting the impeachment hearings.
