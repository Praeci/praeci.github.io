Praeci is a new form of student journalism, presenting NC State and Raleigh news succinctly and beautifully on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Praeci/notifications/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PraeciNews), our [website](praeci.com), or in your podcast feed (currently under construction).

The writing and form of Praeci is influenced by [Axios](axios.com), which prides itself on "delivering vital, trustworthy news and analysis in the most efficient, illuminating and shareable ways possible."

Praeci's presence on Facebook and Twitter will catered to deliver stories and ledes straight to your feed for convenient consumption.
