excerpt: "Thomas Conway arrived at ECSU with a lot on his plate. Two years later, what was he able to accomplish? And why is he retiring?"
---

In the final part of the three-part Chancellor Series, I spoke with Thomas Conway, the chancellor of Elizabeth City State University, an Historically Black University. Conway is retiring after over 40 years in the UNC System, 32 of which he spent at NC State.

We discussed how Dr. Conway is feeling about retiring, how NC State launched him into a successful career in higher education, and what he did to pull ECSU out of a six-year slide it experienced in enrollment and tuition revenue before he arrived on campus.

The Chancellor Series is a series of interviews with leaders in education from around North Carolina who started or built their career at NC State. Each of these individuals have now moved on to become chancellors or presidents of North Carolina colleges and universities, and are making big impacts at those institutions.
