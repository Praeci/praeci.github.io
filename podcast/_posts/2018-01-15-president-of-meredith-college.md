The Chancellor Series is a series of interviews with leaders in education from around North Carolina who started or built their career at NC State. Each of these individuals have now moved on to become chancellors or presidents of North Carolina colleges and universities, and are making big impacts at those institutions.

In the first part of this three-part series, I spoke with Jo Allen, the president of Meredith College. She is the first alumna president of Meredith and has also spent time on the faculty or administration of East Carolina University, NC State University, and Widener University.

We discussed what men who are admitted to Meredith's graduate school gain from attending a women's college, her thoughts on de-prioritization of higher education by the North Carolina legislature, and her perspective on the #MeToo Movement.
