Monica Osburn is the Director of the NC State Counseling Center, which has struggled to grow its operations as the demand from students seeking help grows. Osburn talks about the growth challenges the center has faced, how it's helping students who have survived sexual violence, and how it's addressing the stigma of mental health on campus.
