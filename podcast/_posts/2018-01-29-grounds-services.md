title: "How Grounds Services recovers campus from snow"
excerpt: "Jeff Del Pinal is proud of the work his division does, but it's a thankless job, especially when his bricks are always going missing."

Jeff Del Pinal is the program manager for NC State Ground Services, a part of the Facilities Division. He is responsible for keeping the grounds of NC State safe for students who are walking, biking, or lounging around campus. He does his job with safety and sustainability as top priorities. Jeff also has very early mornings, and that's especially true on snow days.

What does it take to maintain the grounds of the largest college campus in North Carolina after it snows? And is this the guy who decides whether classes get cancelled?
